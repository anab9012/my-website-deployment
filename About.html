            <h1>About</h1>
            <p >Hello There!👋. My names are Anab Abdi Haret. I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree 👩‍🎓 in Computer Science at Garissa University Kenya. The purpose of me making this website is that during my Secondary School years and even in the University I see many people learn but struggle to retain what they have learnt. There is one saying that says one should not work hard but should work smart.What that means in my own understanding means that when you learn a concept like today let's say you  have covered HTML forms you can be able to remember what you have learnt after days and even if I woke you up from your sleep and I asked you you can be able to tell me what you learnt . I have broken down the key considerations into the points below:
     <br><br><ol type="A"><li > <u>Plan for the topics to be studied before hand </u></li>Before one starts learning I usually recommend to prepare in advance the  topics to be learnt since I this usually makes the brain prepared and one won't waste a lot of time when it reaches the time for learning.Personally if I don't plan for the learning early and it reaches the time of studing I usually waste a lot of time figuring out what I should study. <br><br>
     <li> <u>Study for a short while and take rests in between. </u></li> I personally believe that when learning its's not a Must to take a lot of time like 2 hours since this will lead to boredome. Schedule a time frame like one hour or 30 minutes where you remove every distraction and try to focus on what you are learning.Also take some breaks since this will help your brain to refresh and ready for the next activity. Remeber "work without play makes Jack a dull boy". <br><br> <li> <u>Break Topics into small Sprints </u></li>.Inorder to accomplish learning effectively one should break large topics into smaller sub topics and cover them one after the other.This helps one to understand a whole topic easily and even rember it. </ol></p>
    <p>That will be all from me bye 👋🏾  </p>
